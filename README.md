# Neightborhood-Map with React Project

In this project, the application borrows the map API from Google along with the location and address API from Foursquare. The map application displays a list that shows each attraction on the map. A search bar is provided in order to filter the location and map icon. 

## Axios
This application uses Axios in order to make proper XMLHttpRequests. Please click [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to install axios if you wish to git clone this project.
